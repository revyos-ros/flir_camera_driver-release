  * Update Spinnaker.cfg (#50 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/flir_camera_driver/issues/50>)
    Fix for correct spelling with capital letter for bool type
  * Add auto exposure ROI parameters (#52 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/flir_camera_driver/issues/52>)
    * spinnaker_camera_driver: setProperty: report available enum values
    Only done on failure. This helps to figure out which enum values are
    available on a particular camera model.
    * spinnaker_camera_driver: expose AE ROI parameters
    This is highly useful when using fisheye lenses, which illuminate only
    a circle in the center of the image. The AE gets confused by the black
    regions around it and overexposes the image.
    This also exposes the "AutoExposureLightingMode" parameter, which allows
    the user to choose a lighting preset (front/back/normal).
